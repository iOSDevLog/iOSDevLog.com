Sometimesï¼Œyou may not catch the Exception with Try-Catch(eh,you may google the reason ).But here I will suggest you one way may solve your case.The Thread class has a function setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler(Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler eh) to process uncaught exception.

* Make your Activity to implement UncaughtExceptionHandler

```java
public class MainActivity extends Activity implements UncaughtExceptionHandler {
    ....
}
```

* Let your Activity override the uncaughtException

```java
public void uncaughtException(Thread arg0, Throwable arg1) {

        //here to process the uncaught exception

}
```

* In your Activity's OnCreate

Just Call Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler(this); to let it works.

I hope this can do some help .
