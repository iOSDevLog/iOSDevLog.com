[Mouse Recorder for Mac](https://www.jitbit.com/mac-mouse-recorder/)

When I start make Podcast for iOS Development, I think about how should I do.

1. Podcast host, Done!
2. Blog, Done! <http://iosdevlog.com>
3. Code Host, Done! <http://github.com>
4. Video, Maybe!

If I Recorded video, I want to show the *Control Key*. 

so I do an ugly thing like this <https://github.com/iOSDevLog/showShortcuts>.

Now, I find a good software [Mousepos√© 3][https://boinx.com/mousepose/overview/].

I also want to build a software that can recorder what I do.

* First, It can record *Keyboard* type.

* Second, It can record *Mouse* position/click or What I'm doing.

I am afraid there is no time (Capacity is not enough) to do.

Recently, I found a good software 

[Mouse Recorder for Mac](https://www.jitbit.com/mac-mouse-recorder/)

It like the MacOS build in software *Automator* (write applescript code).

I use it several time, vim? no problem. It does not seem to recognize the double click.

Finally, I think [Mouse Recorder](https://www.jitbit.com/macro-recorder/) is better than [Mouse Recorder for Mac](https://www.jitbit.com/mac-mouse-recorder/).

The mouse not alwayse go to the Correct position. I must use vim mode and shortcut key when I want to record video.
